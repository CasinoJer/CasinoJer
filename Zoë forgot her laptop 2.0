Heya J,

I'm sorry to hear that you aren't liking this big case, but your totaly right.
You just need to get it over with so you can move on and put it behind you.
Anyways i just want to say I'm really fucking proud of you and I know that you are working
so hard right now. You must be tired again, I do hope that you made some progress though.
YOU GOT THIS!! And if you don't that's okay!!

Sooo... as you can tell i kinda forgot my laptop AGAIN._. I'm so so so sorry.
Me and Car worked really hard today, we kinda carried the whole day tbh.
After work we went to my parents place because it had been a while.
We ate some dinner and talked about the appartment and furniture and stuff.
Then we had a nice long walk during sundown in the park at Presikhaaf. 
Now Car has a hooikoorts attack and we're chilling a little bit before heading to bed.
Tomorow we need to work again, kinda tired but at least we're together.

And about feeling the need to do stupid stuff, I get that. But look at the girlboss 
you are being right now. It's worth it. And you have enough time after this to do
stupid stuff. With stupid people. In stupid places. Orrrrrr you could totally hang out
With equally cool people. And do cool stuff. In cool places.
Like have a reading date, watch thrillers and eat noodleworks. Craft some scrapbooks.
Put together a miniture alleyway for your bookshelves, or create a bucketlist scrapbook.
I also feel the need to do stupid stuff tho, like i haven't been drunk in forever.
I wonder how Car would act on alcohol. Hehe. 

Anyways I imagine that you are really stuck with your thoughts and probably a bit down
with all this time to think about yourself and your life. I just want to say that whenever you feel
like a dark emo boy. It's normal with all this time to yourself. I mean, life is kinda hard. But hey!
You have a fucking awesome brain, some really cool friends, a family and so so much more.
But i know how you feel, and if you ever feel the need to ventilate, please do. I'm always here for you.
besides I love reading your letters and hearing your stories. 

Just know that without the bad, the good wouldn't be as good.
Anyways This letter is getting really long so I'm gonna stop now and call it a day.
 I love you so much, I'm so proud of you and I'm here whenever you need me.

Hugs,
ZoÃ«
