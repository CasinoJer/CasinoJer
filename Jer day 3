So... you would think that on a Saturday, Jer would do some pretty some pretty
awesome stuff... Well not quite... I have to study so much shit dude. If you
could have a look at my schedule dude... I woke up at 10am. Im still sore from
legday and chestday so my workout for today was basicly a lot of shadowboxing.
Then I just studied from 12pm to 10pm. Dont worry, I had a couple breaks tho.
During one of those breaks Leo and I went kind of sight seeing. AKA, explore
abandoned places. There was lots of grafitti. Which made me realise something. 
When I'm back in NL, I wannadrop my own tag somewhere. But yeah.. that was
my morning and afternoon. Im gonna head to town in a couple minutes from now.
The evening is still young. So we'll see what happens.

Read the 4th letter!! Girl... You picked a topic dude...
Sometimes... you just have to accept things as day are. For example, you want
to achieve something. To achieve something you have to put time and effort into
it. How more time and effort, the better the endresult. However, our time is
limited. Which means that sometimes you can not achieve the endresult you want
you achieve. And when you find yourself in that situation, you might have to
except that your maximum input, might not result into the desired output.
But that is okay. When you really have used everything, you should be proud of
yourself, whatever the outcome may be. Also... there is one other thing. 
You wrote in your letter that I'm an honest person and I feel really flatterd
that you think of me that way, but in reality, I don't think I am. I lie a lot
you know. Its just my thing. It's easy. Most of the time I don't even think twice
about the consequences. Altho, you're right about me being honnest to myself. That
part is true. To bad that the truth is a bit more depressing than the world of lies
I created. But thats that. Also thanks for calling me a girlboss!! I know I am! I'm
awesome.

Love you 2 ZoÃ«.
