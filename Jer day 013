hey,

First, Im gonna destroy you in 8 ball pool. Second, I miss you and our 
games a lot. Playing against you has always been fun. At mario kart,
wario smooth moves, badminton, and of course pool. Soon I'll play
another game against you. Real soon.

I'm wondering if you're actually reading these letters. I think you do
but I actually haven't had confirmation yet, that you've even found this
platform. Well.. if you've read them or not, eventually you will.

Btw, I might have sounded a bit overdramatic in the last letter. My
situation actually isn't that bad. I mean, there is definetely something
that is bothering me, but when I layed down in bed, I realized that I have
to accept how thing are, and be happy with what I already have. Wich is you
for example. Im pretty you sure wouldn't leave me. I have parents. A
home. Solid education. It isn't all that bad.

For now I'm just really looking forward to seeing you again. Believe it or
not, but I need an escape from my escape.
