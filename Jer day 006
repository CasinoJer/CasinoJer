First of all... love this song.

Second, girl... we need to get Ricardo and you an appartement asap. This can't go on
any longer. We just need to find you guys a appartement. No question about it
There has to be something you could do to speed up the process. Maybe someone who
could help you guys. Maybe you could ask around. Im sure you guys aren't the only
ones looking. I'll ask around to when Im back. (If you guys dont haven't found one yet.)
Maybe I meet someone at a party with connections that could help you guys out.
I've helped people out in the past with looking for IT-jobs you know. 

My uncle is recruitment partner at findr. So he basicly goes to companies that are 
looking for engineers, data scientists, testers, programmers dev ops, hackers, etc, 
and then he starts looking for people that are a good fit for the job. This way, people
like me, don't have to go through the entire process of applying to a companny. 
We can just start working right away, do our job, get paid, leave, and start looking 
for a new job.

Anyway, what Im trying to say is, that there has to be something or someone that could
help you out with finding a new appartment. And when you finally do have your own appartement,
you can begin buying random stuff like tableware, cocktail glasses, plates, cutlery. etc.
You should definetely go to the Xenos. They have a lots of cute stuff.

Btw, quick summary of my day: It was misserable. We wanted to die. There was no opening.
No vulnerability. Nothing. Just dead end, after dead end. We were working hours, looking
an entry point, but there was noting. Litterly nothing. So that sucks.

Oh well...

Anyway, see you tommorow.
